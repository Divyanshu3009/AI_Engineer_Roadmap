# AI Basics – Conceptual Foundations

This document provides a high-level understanding of the AI ecosystem,
including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI.

It is meant for conceptual clarity, not implementation.

## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is a systems that mimics human intelligence
such as learning, reasoning, perception, and language understanding.

AI is an umbrella term that includes Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI.

## 2. AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

- AI is the broad field of making machines intelligent.
- Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data.
- Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to automatically learn features from raw data.

The key difference between ML and DL is feature handling:
ML relies on manual feature engineering, while DL learns features automatically.

## 3. Neural Networks

Neural networks are models inspired by the human brain, consisting of
layers of interconnected neurons.

### Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)

- Data flows in one direction: input → output
- No memory or context
- Used for basic classification and regression

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Specialized for image data
- Detects spatial patterns such as edges and shapes
- Commonly used in image classification and object detection

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

- Designed for sequential data
- Maintains memory of previous inputs
- Used in text, speech, and time-series problems

## 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a field of AI focused on enabling machines
to understand and process human language.

It includes rule-based methods, machine learning approaches,
and deep learning models.

Common NLP tasks include text classification, sentiment analysis,
and language translation.

## 5. Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models are deep learning models based on the Transformer
architecture, trained on massive text datasets.

They understand and generate language contextually and are widely used
via APIs rather than trained from scratch.

## 6. Generative AI (GenAI)

Generative AI refers to systems that can generate new content such as
text, images, code, or audio.

It is primarily powered by LLMs and diffusion-based models.

## 7. Agentic AI

Agentic AI systems can plan tasks, make decisions, use tools,
and interact with external systems.

They combine LLMs with memory, tools, and logic to solve multi-step problems.
It is an combination of AI Agents.

## 8. Scope of This Document

This document focuses on conceptual understanding.
Implementation, math, and hands-on projects are covered
in later stages of the roadmap.
