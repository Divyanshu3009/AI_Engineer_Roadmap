# About the Project:

This is a simple command line Python program that helps remind users to take their medicines on time.
It was built as a Python skill test, focusing on logic, data handling, and time-based execution, not on UI or advanced frameworks.

# What This Program Does:

Lets the user add medicines from the terminal

## Allows choosing when to take the medicine:

Morning
Afternoon
Night

## Supports conditions:

Before food
After food

Then groups medicines that have the same time and condition

# At reminder time:

Asks “Have you eaten?” only once (if needed)
Snoozes the reminder if food is not eaten
Reminds all medicines together

# The goal of this project is to:

Practice core Python concepts
Work with lists, dictionaries, and functions & Understand time-based logic
Build a clean CLI-based solution
